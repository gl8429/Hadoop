# TextAnalyzer
In this project, we implement a text analyzer using Hadoop, which is a programming model and software framework for developing applications that concurrently process large scale data (Big Data) on distributed systems. The analyzer has to build a table that shows the occurrences of the words that appear together in the given text. The data set for this problem is the novel Pride and Prejudice.
